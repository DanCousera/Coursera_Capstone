# Coursera_Capstone

This is the repository of the Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone Project.
It contains the Jupyter Notebook, the report and the presentation (CapStone.ipynb, 
capstone_report.pdf, capstone_presentation.pdf).

The project aims at generating a restaurant map for Toronto based on the 
location and rating of the restaurants. The Foursquare API was used to get
infos about each restaurant.

The results of the API calls have been saved as .csv files(toronto_neigborhoods.csv,
toronto_ratings.csv,toronto_venues.csv) and added to the repository.

The generated map (toronto_restaurant_clusters.html) is also included.
